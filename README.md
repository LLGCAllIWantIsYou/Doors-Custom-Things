# Doors Custom Things
## Credit
Credits to [Vynixu](https://github.com/RegularVynixu/) for all of the base doors mods and UI library because I'm relatively new to Lua so thanks to them :D

## About
So, I see you've stumbled upon this repo. This is just a bunch of goofy scripts I made for the Roblox game Doors in one simple UI. This requires an executor to use, so go search up a decent executor if you need one (anything but JJSploit should suffice)

I've wanted to make scripts for doors for a while now, and so hopefully this works as an alternative to stuff like other entity spawners or something and provides a good bit of entertainment. Who knows? Maybe I could make the 47th hardcore mode script if I research enough.

# How to Use
So how would one use this hodgepodge of random stuff? Easy. Just copy this script right here and you should be good once you execute it! **You have to be in a game for it to work correctly.**
`loadstring(game:HttpGet(("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrNooberDude/Doors-Custom-Things/main/mainScript.lua"),true))()`

**If you want to see and steal the very few bits of unique code, then go for it!** I don't care really that much about a few kilobytes of data anyway considering how annoying it is when I see something interesting in a script and then can't see how it works (because I want to learn how to do it), so maybe this will be a bit nice for people like me.

# FAQ (probably)

## Do I need a specific executor? (e.g. Synapse, Krnl...)
**Short Answer:** You shouldn't worry about compatibility.  
**Long Answer:** Unless you are using a pretty low level exploit, everything should go as planned. So stuff like Synapse X, Scriptware, KRNL, Fluxus, they all should work fine.

## Will I get banned for using this?
**Short Answer:** If you're using an alt, you shouldn't really worry.  
**Long Answer:** Maybe in multiplayer cause other people can't see the entities, but again, it honestly just depends on your executor and if Roblox can detect it. If it does, then try using a different executor.
