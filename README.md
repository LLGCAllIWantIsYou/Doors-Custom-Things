# Doors-Custom-Things
Credits to [Vynixu](https://github.com/RegularVynixu/) for all of the base doors mods and UI library because I'm relatively new to Lua so thanks to them :D

Anyway...
# How to Use
So how would one use this flaming pile of garbage? Easy. Just copy this script right here and you should be good!  
`loadstring(game:HttpGet(("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrNooberDude/Doors-Custom-Things/mainScript.lua"),true))()`

**If you want to see and steal the very few bits of unique code, then go for it!** I don't care really that much about a few kilobytes of data anyway!
